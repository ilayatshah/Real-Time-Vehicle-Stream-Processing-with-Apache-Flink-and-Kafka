# Real-Time-Vehicle-Stream-Processing-with-Apache-Flink-and-Kafka
This application is designed to process real-time stream data of vehicles using Apache Flink and Kafka. It retrieves data from a Kafka topic and processes it in real-time, enabling batch inserts based on a defined time difference. The processed data is then stored in an HBase using GeoMesa.
